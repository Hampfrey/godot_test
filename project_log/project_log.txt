INTRODUCTION

Goal: Students will be able to demonstrate the daily class work done for their independent project through a daily class journal for each class period in this and the next week.
Instructions:
  - Choose a format for this log (this may depend on the tool used) - I recommend a Google doc or Trello or similar tool that can be used for this type of format.

Do the following for each day of work: date, goals, evidence, and recap/review
  - Date: Identify the date
  - Goals: Write a list of specific (and measurable) goals for that day (2-3 should suffice) - do this before doing any of your work.
  - Work on your tasks (this should be most of the work time).
  - Evidence: Make sure if your project is on Git (and it hopefully is), that you make at least one commit for the day.
  - Take a screen capture or video of the progress of your project.
  - Recap/Review: With 15-20 minutes remaining, review the progress you made towards your goal.
  - Identify what still needs to be done to meet the goal (in case it wasn't met), any problems you encountered, and what your next steps should be.
  - There should be 4 entries in all

Scoring: will be 1 category (requirements), and for a proficient grade, you should meet the following:
  - 4 entries complete with date, goals for the day, evidence of work (screen captures commits), and a recap.
  - Specific details (for goals, evidence, and recap).
  - Clear formatting: I recommend labels or headings for each section and some kind of clear delineation (like a horizontal line) between entries.

 g: brainstorm next steps
    map ESC to change fullscreen to windowed and vice versa
    
 r: ESC not yet mapped
    need some game design elements, some kind of basic level should suffice. A few enemies should bounce around and need to be taken out
    also want to add some more puzzle elements
    had an experience where the dvds pushed player out of the map [250121_outside], it was interesting and slightly liminal to follow the blocks as we all moved diagonally accross an infinite plain, where the only way to even see if we were moving was knowing the blocks were moving.
